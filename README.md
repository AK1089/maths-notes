# Cambridge Mathematics Lecture Notes

A collection of lecture notes for various Cambridge Mathematics courses, taken during Part II of the Mathematical Tripos. These notes are unofficial and may contain errors. While they are written and published with permission, they are not endorsed by the lecturer or University.

Please see the page on my website for quick downloads and a summary: https://ak1089.github.io/maths/notes.

## Compiling the Notes

These notes require my custom `mathsnotes.sty` style file to compile. The source TeX for each course's notes is in its own directory.

I use and recommend [Texifier](https://www.texifier.com/) for compilation. It handles the build process smoothly and includes all necessary packages. It also has a beautiful and performant live typesetter, which I really cannot overstate the utility of. It allowed me to take these notes at the speed of thought without waiting for compilation.

## License and Usage

These notes are my own work and not officially endorsed by the University of Cambridge or the lecturers. In particular, they may contain errors -- please report any such issues via:
- GitHub Issues or a pull request

You are welcome to use everything here for your own study, and edit them as you wish, so long as you provide attribution when sharing them.

I would like to thank the lecturers who created and taught all these interesting courses and allowed me to publish these notes.
